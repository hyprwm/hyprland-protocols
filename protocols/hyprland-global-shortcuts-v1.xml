    This protocol allows a client to register keystrokes that will be passed
    to it regardless of its focus state.

      <description summary="register a shortcut">
        Register a new global shortcut.

        A keystroke is composed in a format of:
        [MOD...+]KEY

        for example:
        SUPER+A or ALT+SHIFT+K

        A keystroke is not required to have a MOD, although compositors might implement
        security measures and reject such keybinds.
