        Create a hyprland surface object for the given wayland surface.

      This interface allows access to hyprland-specific properties of a wl_surface.

        Sets a multiplier for the overall opacity of the surface.
        This multiplier applies to visual effects such as blur behind the surface
        in addition to the surface's content.

        The default value is 1.0.
        Setting a value outside of the range 0.0 - 1.0 (inclusive) is a protocol error.
